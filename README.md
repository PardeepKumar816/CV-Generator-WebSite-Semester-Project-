CV Generator Using Express.js

Introduction: 
CV Generator is a web application that generates a CV for the user based on the personal information provided. The user can enter their name, contact information, work experience, education, and other details, and the website generates a professional-looking CV which can then be printed. The project was built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Express.js, and MySQL.
User Manual / Usage:
 To use the CV Generator, the user needs to access the website and fill in their personal information in the input fields provided. The user can preview the CV and make changes if necessary. Once the user is satisfied with the CV, they can download it as a PDF or print it directly from the website. The user's information is also stored in a MySQL database for future use.
Technology: 
The front-end of the website was built using HTML and CSS. Custom assets such as logos and icons were also created for the project. The back end was built using JavaScript and Express.js to integrate with the MySQL database. 
Installation:
The installation process for the CV Generator is straightforward. There is no need for any explicit installation. The user can simply open the project in Visual Studio Code and run the live server to access the website.
Challenges Faced:
During the development of the CV Generator, the team faced several challenges. One of the significant challenges was ensuring that the CSS did not break when the user printed the CV. The team had to find a way to make the CSS printer-friendly, which involved several trials and errors.
Another challenge faced by the team was connecting MySQL with Node.js. Initially, the team faced an error stating that the "required()" function was not defined. They had to switch to Express.js and use the ES6 import/export syntax to solve this problem.
Other challenges that the team faced during development mostly involved the JavaScript code. However, with persistence and trial and error, the team was able to overcome these challenges.

Conclusion:
The CV Generator is a web application that makes it easy for users to create professional-looking CVs quickly. The application's simple and user-friendly interface makes it accessible to a broad range of users. The project's development involved the use of various technologies, including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Express.js, and MySQL, among others.
